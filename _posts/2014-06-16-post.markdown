![811 doesn't even know what this is](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0033.JPG)

So I mentioned last week that I had a bunch of loose threads that I was trying to figure out. Some of them might be useful to put out to the world, since there are probably a lot of people working on this sort of stuff or who know more about it than me. 

##Manhole Covers That Don't Appear to be Telco-Related

![This manhole cover speaks LIES.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/bpm.JPG)

So this is a manhole cover that most sources say stands for "Borough Manhattan President", and apparently it means that the manhole cover was constructed by the office of the borough president at...some point. I suppose there isn't any reason this wouldn't be a manhole cover that offered access to ECS ducts, but it's confusing. I've also seen some NYC sewer manhole covers with orange cable markings. 

One really important aspect of New York's internet infrastructure is that it's *really fucking messy*. So while a BPM manhole cover or an NYC sewer cover might have access to telecommunications cables, I don't think it is safe to say all of them do. 

##Some Super-Confusing Markings and One Kind of Nice Obvious Connection Moment

![No one knows what's even going on.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0032.JPG)

This is a larger image of the photo that started this blog post. That text reads "as per print". I think that this means the person sent to mark these cables by 811 doubts the map he was given. 

![No one knows what's even going on.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0038.JPG)

So this either says "now fiber" or "new fiber" and the difference in those meanings is kind of important. The fact it's part of a path for TV cable is a nice reminder that lots, lots, lots of things run over fiber-optic cable--finding fiber doesn't always mean finding the internet. 

![No one knows what's even going on.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0039.JPG)

It's just kind of nice when you see exactly where the cable's going. 

##Distributed Antenna Systems
Investigating cable franchise agreements on DoITT's website also pointed me to DoITT's various franchise agreements for "Mobile Telecommunications" on poletops. Basically these are for companies that want to add equipment to street poles, specifically equipment for Distributed Antenna Systems. A DAS (not to be confused with the [NYPD's DAS](http://www.microsoft.com/government/en-us/state/brightside/Pages/details.aspx?Microsoft-and-NYPD-Announce-Partnership-Providing-Real-Time-Counterterrorism-Solution-Globally&blogid=697)) is infrastructure that adds mobile network coverage to hard-to-reach areas (a longer description is [here](http://www.crowncastle.com/das/)). If you see an orange cable feeding into a street pole, look up. It probably has some DAS equipment. 

I've seen two variations of the equipment: some with antennas and some without antennas.  

![Antennaed DAS.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0035.JPG)

![Not antennaed DAS.](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0022.JPG)

So I'm not sure if the ones without antennas are actually functional or not. Most of the not-antennaed ones I've seen have had fiber markings labeled "NXTG", which probably refers to NextG's franchise. NextG was acquired by competitor Cross Castle (who also have a separate franchise agreement with the city). 

##Office Building Dataspace
A lot of the data centers of lower Manhattan are well-known and well-mapped. Midtown is a little bit harder to identify. Part of that might be because a lot of the data needs in Midtown are for big financial services companies in their big flagship skyscrapers. One of the things I'd started to think might indicate data space in these buildings were the rows and rows of vents staggered in different parts of the building, like this one on 1285 Avenue of the Americas: 

![1285 Avenue of the Americas](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0042.JPG)

I assumed this partly because 375 Pearl Street, a massive data center more commonly known to New Yorkers as "that hideous Verizon building you see coming over the Manhattan Bridge", has a few of these big vent-things.

![375 Pearl Street](http://irl.so/20140606/img/DSC_0012.JPG)

But that also could just be a sign of a mechanical floor, the centralized space dedicated to maintaining utility needs for the entire building--electricity and temperature and all sorts of other things, not just telecommunications. The many, many fans and cooling systems that are really obvious signifiers of a data center in northern Virginia are kind of just signifiers of scale on a Manhattan building.

Anecdata about the networks of major Midtown-based banks (Bank of America, JPMorgan) suggests that there's a fair amount of data space in the area, but also that there's a lot of cables in use--which makes sense, given the number of colocation centers directly across the river in Weehawken, NJ. (*Flash Boys* at one point mentions FO cables running through the Lincoln Tunnel to these nearby data centers; presumably there's a lot of direct, bank-controlled fiber lines in the area--I've only heard specifically about JPMorgan's.)

##The Networks Of Midtown Manhattan
I suspect that Midtown's internet infrastructure has grown over the last few years, but it's mostly anecdotal stuff more related to the other networks of Midtown. 

####Past Networks: Pneumatic Tubes

![Tuuuuuuubes](http://irl.so/img/20140616/Pneumatic-Tube-NYC-Vintage-Photo.jpg)

It's sometimes hard for me to believe that people in New York City actually used pneumatic tubes for correspondence because it just sounds too *delightful* to be true. Through the 27 miles of subterranean tubes in Manhattan, correspondence circulated at around 30 miles an hour. The New York Public Library used to use pneumatic tubes for sending requests for books to librarians; I've been lucky enough to see the desk in the old stacks where the tubes were sent. 

A [2001 New York Times article](http://www.nytimes.com/2001/05/07/nyregion/underground-mail-road-modern-plans-for-all-but-forgotten-delivery-system.html) mentions an entrepreneur named Randolph Stark who wanted to run fiber through the pneumatic system. He filed a [patent](http://www.google.com/patents/US6603907) for doing this. Apparently 9/11 made the project disappear, and there's little beyond 2004 about the idea to use the tubes for cabling. 

####Broadcast Row

I recently was in the Rockefeller center neighborhood and started to wonder whether the [1500-plus miles of wiring and cables](http://www.rockefellercenter.com/art-and-history/history/nbc-studios/) originally installed for NBC Studios might have provided a basis for developing other telecommunications infrastructure in the area. It might explain some of the tenants of the nearby former Rockefeller buildings--Fox News, investment management firm Paulson & Co., and Barclays Capital. 

Of course, 30 Rock isn't the only building with television studios--there's the aforementioned Fox News building, the CBS Building up the street, and was once home to ABC and CNN studios. 

####C.R.E.A.M.--Cops Review Everything Around Me (via CCTV Cameras)

![UBS logo, NYPD camera](http://irl.so/img/20140616/DSC_0045.JPG)

1285 Avenue of the Americas is the [flagship office](http://financialservicesinc.ubs.com/branch/newyorkjg/) of UBS Financial Services in New York. Their logo's on the front entrance. There are other tenants, including advertising agency [BBDO](http://www.bbdo.com/) and technology services company [Rockefeller Group Technology Solutions](http://www.rgts.com/about/index.html). But I suspect that UBS is the reason there are two NYPD surveillance cameras on that block. 

![UBS logo, NYPD camera](http://irl.so/img/20140616/1251_block.png)

Midtown was the first area where the NYPD [expanded its Lower Manhattan Security Initiative](http://www.wnyc.org/story/73260-ring-of-steel-coming-to-midtown/). The neighborhood has hundreds of cameras, most of which have ID numbers (tangent: has anyone noticed the number of NYPD-marked cameras without ID numbers, and is that a normal thing?). 

Estimates for exactly how many NYPD cameras are in Midtown remains unclear. While looking for a number I found [this 2008 article](http://www.citylimits.org/news/articles/3957/secrecy-shrouds-nypd-s-anti-terror-camera-system#.U59buC_OlxM) by Ali Winston (side note: Ali Winston is a really, really good reporter, did you guys know) that mentioned a number of interesting redactions, including this one: 

>The 2009 document also details NYPD's plans to build out an integrated camera network for Manhattan and the Outer Boroughs, as reported by City Limits last year: "The NYPD has begun acquiring a dedicated (REDACTED) network to encompass all of Manhattan as well as the outer boroughs of NYC." 

I could go deeper on municipal (including police) networked objects, though I'd kind of rather just direct you to Mayo Nissen's [really good blog post](http://designmind.frogdesign.com/articles/unseen-sensors-constantly-sensing-but-rarely-seen.html) about it. Frankly, one of the reasons I assume Midtown has a lot of internet infrastructure is because it has a lot of police cameras. Power attracts power,networks attract networks, and systems of control protect other systems of control.
