# The cloud is not the territory: in search of data centers

Debates over online privacy tends to discuss who has your data, but there's less conversation about *where* that data is. Usually, the shorthand is "in the cloud" --- which is to say, a server somewhere, or a bunch of servers that are connected to other servers. While technically accurate, this description lends itself to further occlusion. One imagines metadata floating, like a thought bubble in a comic strip, away from a personal computer to some impossible anywhere-and-everywhere destination. Last fall, I decided to try to see where data lived.

Going to data centers to understand mass surveillance is, admittedly, kind of like studying rook design to understand chess. They are just one piece of an apparatus: relevant in use, not in abstract. But internet infrastructure is in specific places for specific reasons --- natural resources, politics, the history of the internet itself. The hidden geography of data is folded into a larger geography of corporate and state power. I hoped that learning more about the former might offer some insight into how we perceive --- and potentially challenge --- the latter. 

First, I had to find them. Companies that operate data centers vary widely in their approaches to transparency. Some are very open, allowing clients to tour the facilities, while others are much more secretive, citing security concerns. My itinerary was shaped by an interest in two companies: COPT, a real estate company dedicated to building office properties and data centers for defense contractors, and Amazon, a company that has fundamentally changed how people live on the internet and where the internet lives. Convenience and internet history led both companies, and me, to northern Virginia. 

Northern Virginia is home to the Dulles Technology Corridor, a region named for its international airport and its many defense and technology contractors. Partly because of its proximity to Defense Department outposts, by the early 1990s the region was already home to a major piece of [internet backbone](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_backbone). In 1992, Loudoun County became home to MAE-East, one of the first [internet exchange points](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_exchange_point). Being close to the backbone and to an IX buys data centers milliseconds of advantage over competitors. In an industry obsessed with efficiency, milliseconds matter. 

Loudoun County offers a number of incentives to data centers: a [brochure](http://biz.loudoun.gov/DocumentCenter/View/26) notes that local power rates for industrial use is 28 percent below the national average, and Virginia offers retail and use-tax exemptions for "computer equipment, chillers, and backup generators." Data centers have contributed to the region's tax base; according to 2012 Census data, Loudoun County had the highest median income in the United States at $117,876 per year. An estimated [70 percent of internet traffic](http://www.washingtonpost.com/business/capitalbusiness/data-centers-boom-in-loudoun-county-but-jobs-arent-following/2014/01/17/b4a704c8-7f0e-11e3-93c1-0e888170b723_story.html) goes through Loudoun County's 8 million square feet of data centers every day.

While the bizarre office temples of the National Business Park at least hinted at human life, this pilgrimage was marked by architecture and aesthetics optimized for machines, not humans. If anything, it was more like trying to visit a factory farm: going to a place I wasn't supposed to be, where I might not like or want to know what happened inside, and where the practices and industry in play were both beyond and entirely human.

The first data center I sought out was DC-6, a colocation data center in Manassas purchased purchased by COPT in 2010 from Power Loft, LLC. A [video](http://vimeo.com/45519251) of DC-6 shows selective glimpses of the data center's interior, where men (only men) perform "mission critical" work with diligence and ease.

Having first seen the location in satellite map views, I was surprised by the rambling topography and the sheer scale of the compound. There were no other businesses within easy walking distance. Road construction hummed around the bend. The isolation of the site and its giant black gates were intimidating, leading me to photograph from a distance. These lonely data center aesthetics do serve one human demographic: the people renting space there. The DC-6's isolated location and heavy fortification signified security and secrecy --- which presumably extends from its gates to its server racks.

After visiting DC-6, I took a brief detour to Manassas National Battlefield Park, a site commemorating the first battle of the American Civil War. Manassas was the original code name for the program later more famously known as [Bullrun](http://www.propublica.org/article/the-nsas-secret-campaign-to-crack-undermine-internet-encryption), a counterencryption program run by the NSA and named for another Civil War battle.

Again I was struck by the uneasy resonance of the surveillance landscape, where large pieces of infrastructure in the new [global battlefield](http://www.heritage.org/research/commentary/2013/11/fighting-on-the-cyber-battlefield-weak-states-and-nonstate-actors-pose-threats) are adjacent to battlefields from a very different conflict over economics, resources, and self-determination.

In January 2013, COPT announced that it had purchased a [34-acre site](http://www.bizjournals.com/washington/breaking_ground/2013/01/copt-to-develop-ashburn-data-center-site.html?ana=&page=all) in Loudon County, Va., for $14 million. Amazon was to be its primary tenant. In March of 2013, Amazon announced it had secured a $600 million contract with the CIA to provide the intelligence agency [cloud computing services](http://www.businessinsider.com/details-emerge-on-amazons-cia-cloud-2013-6). 

Since the CIA contract is for private services within existing CIA data centers, it seems unlikely this center under construction is "the" CIA-Amazon data center. However, Amazon job descriptions for Engineering Operations Technicians in Ashburn require applicants to "obtain and maintain a Top Secret security clearance with Sensitive Compartmented Information (TS/SCI) eligibility and access" (a requirement not included on listings for the same position in other cities). Perhaps these Ashburn sites are among data centers that are part of the [AWS GovCloud](http://aws.amazon.com/govcloud-us/). 

![Ashburn Crossing](http://irl.so/img/clouds/ashburn_crossing.png)

A brochure advertising the parcel highlights the site's many benefits for data center construction, including its proximity to three power substations and a transmission line, as well as the Loudoun County water plant, which offers "reclaimed water available for cooling systems on-site." The property is also extremely close to several internet exchanges and other data centers.

A recent [article](http://www.datacenterknowledge.com/archives/2014/03/04/copt-federal-space-drives-growing-data-center-business/) about COPT's data centers indicates that part one of the compoud has gone up, but when I visited the site it was still mostly dirt. In a lot across from the site, a strangely suburban condominum complex was going up. The new buildings were part of [Ashby Ponds](http://www.ericksonliving.com/loudoun-county/loudoun-county-senior-living.asp), an assisted living community. It made some sense that new housing would be for the retired and not a workforce. COPT's new construction is estimated to bring $300 million in investment to Loudoun County, but only 45 jobs.

This construction boom isn't welcomed by everyone. Western Loudoun County is a more rural area, more connected to Virginia's agriculture industry. In 2005, there was talk of the western part of the county [seceding](http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A55489-2005Mar21.html) from Loudoun because of zoning law changes that threatened to expand development. Advocates of secession eventually backed off, although conflict over development contines to divide the county. 

The construction shaping the landscape of Northern Virginia is instrumental to the landscape of the internet itself, but it's not easy to draw a line from physical properties to particular accountability or direct action. I tried to imagine a tent city of protestors on the construction site, thousands of sit-ins surrounding data centers like the ones Occupy Wall Street did in bank branches. But physically protesting outside privately held data centers is strategically weak (it doesn't actually stop the flow of information any more than protesting in bank branches stops high-frequency trading) and sybolically lacking (if a protest seeks accountability from tech companies for the surveillance state, it's more likely to be found in corner offices and regulatory agencies, not on server farms).

Shortly before I ventured on this trip, I got a message from a friend saying he might have found me an Amazon data center in Virginia. He sent me some coordinates and provided an outline of his methods, which involved geolocating IP addresses found via traceroute and an errant label somehow still on Google Maps: a building in Sterling bearing the name "Amazon-Vadata." (Vadata is a legal entity owned by Amazon, essentially the corporate handle for its data centers.)

Although I thought of this as one of the more intimidating sites on my itinerary, it proved to be the smallest and the closest to a semblance of civilization. It was next to a pet resort, down the road from a mall, and a short drive away from Raytheon offices.  

No signs declared the building's tenant. The only logos I noticed were those of Caterpillar, which were on the generators, and Allied Barton, which was on the badge of the security guard who eventually asked me to stop taking photos. This more or less concluded the day's expedition.

I returned home and retraced my steps with my phone, which had been quietly collecting my location data all day and sending it to a Google server somewhere, possibly in northern Virginia. While I had struggled to seek out pieces of the cloud, the cloud kept a pretty good pulse on my location.

[Here's what they look like on a map](http://irl.so/cloudy).

Users accept this information asymmetry in part because of a misunderstanding that the internet does not take up space, and since it doesn't take up real space our data isn't *really* somewhere else, or in the hands of someone else. But by placing our data in the cloud, and in the hands of private companies that readily comply with national security letters and sell our data to third parties, it's effectively no longer ours.

Data takes up space. The space it takes up --- and the water, land and electricity that get used in taking it up --- remains, for the most part, out of sight, out of mind and utterly uninteresting to actually look at. There are exceptions to this model of internet infrastructure as inaccessible obelisk, in particular the [Internet Archive](http://archive.org), which has made its servers part of its public community space. Exceptions illustrate that the veneer of secrecy around data center geography is a *choice*, one that further estranges users from their own data. 

**[it would be nice to have a picture of the Internet Archive here]**

Lifting the fog that surrounds the cloud isn't merely a matter of locating many nondescript buildings, but of looking at all the other elements that make its many particles crystallize. Mass surveillance in the U.S. is a complex public-private partnership, and the data-industrial complex is but one of its sprawling pieces. Beneath headlines about the spooks of the surveillance state are normal, non-spooky humans in normal, non-spooky places --- engineers working at colocation centers used by defense contractors, county economic development offices looking to expand a local tax base, real estate companies looking to get into a new market, [energy companies](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/technology/data-centers-waste-vast-amounts-of-energy-belying-industry-image.html?pagewanted=1&_r=0) that welcome the profits born of an industry that uses more electricity than some small nations. 

None of these normal, non-spooky humans are directly responsible for the rise of mass surveillance, but they are instrumental in maintaining the surveillance apparatus. None of the infrastructure that they work with has to by design function as an instrument of surveillance. Funding for government cloud infrastructure could prioritize uses other than the intelligence community and law enforcement (like the use of AWS cloud services by [NASA](http://www.nasa.gov/press/2013/november/nasa-brings-earth-science-big-data-to-the-cloud-with-amazon-web-services/#.UxjCXuddUv4) to make climate datasets publicly available). Companies could be compelled by regulatory bodies to treat user privacy as their right and not an optional [commodity](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/03/04/opinion/has-privacy-become-a-luxury-good.html?_r=0). Internet infrastructure could be treated like the *actual infrastructure* it is --- like highways, like water management, like food safety, like something that a public has a right to understand and its proprietors have a responsibility to explain transparently. 

In trying to see where data lived, I hoped to better understand how we live with data and, by extension, with the myriad forms of surveillance it enables. We live with data by pretending that we don't. The shorthanding of infrastructure and policy --- and the insistence that ideally, users *shouldn't* know or need to know how the infrastructure or policy works --- also occludes the physical realities, economic asymmetries, and damaging consequences that come with it. Ultimately, in a geography of power, the cloud is not the territory.
