##Hi. I'm Ingrid, and normally I'm on the internet [here](http://lifewinning.com) and [here](http://twitter.com/lifewinning).

##This is a repository of writing, images, data, and other material relevant to a project I'm working on as a resident at [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org) this spring. 

##These are some things I'm thinking about: 

1. The infrastructure and architecture of networked hardware and software has a lot in common with the history and practices of urban planning and state-making, and those practices have a lot to do with how we think about and understand surveillance. 

2. The question of *who controls the internet* cannot be answered without understanding *where and how the internet lives* --- as a body of infrastructure built with particular contexts, as a body of interfaces built in particular contexts, as a series of policy-making bodies and institutions. 

3. How to use geography as a challenge to plausible deniability, how to recognize when geography is used as an enabler of plausible deniability. 

This site's going to have different things that I'm working on, also notes on things that I'm doing. 

Also, here are some quotes I really like: 

> ###There was and is no offline; it is a lusted-after fetish object that some claim special ability to attain, and it has always been a phantom.

(Nathan Jurgenson, ["The IRL Fetish"](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-irl-fetish/), *The New Inquiry*)

> ###There's no real separation between the real world and the internet. What we've begun to see now is a militarization of that space.
