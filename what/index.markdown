###This is a repository of writing, images, data, and recordings relevant to a project I'm working on as a resident at [Eyebeam](http://eyebeam.org). Ostensibly it is about the ways that systems of surveillance and control influence


**The internet is and has always been real life.**

> There was and is no offline; it is a lusted-after fetish object that some claim special ability to attain, and it has always been a phantom.(Nathan Jurgenson, ["The IRL Fetish"](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/the-irl-fetish/), *The New Inquiry*)

I'm interested in the infrastructure and architecture of networked hardware and software, both of which offer parallels to architectural and urban planning history. I hesitate to compare internet infrastructure to *actual* infrastructure because well, the internet *is* actual infrastructure --- and the development of this infrastructure is not so different from the histories of other now-ubiquitous infrastructures. Similarly, software interfaces are not all that different from other legibility structures that make places "real", that turn land into states and people into citizens. 

It is not news to say that networked hardware (in phones, in appliances, in textiles) is an increasingly common thing, and a thing that will probably only become more common. It is perhaps also not news to note that increased personal computing requires increased infrastructural support for the network itself. Big Data requires bigger data storage, requires more data centers, requires more cables, better cables. 
  
**Real life is and has long been a contested political space.**

> There's no real separation between the real world and the internet. What we've begun to see now is a militarization of that space. (Jacob Appelbaum, [interview with *Vice*](http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/jacob-appelbaum-utopia-interview), 6 October 2013)

I remember people comparing the beauty of the community in Zuccotti Park to the internet. I remember people on the internet talking about how the future of Zuccotti Park was online. What is the internet if not a [massive collection of privately-held public spaces](http://thenewinquiry.com/essays/public-spaces/), in varying states of occupation? 

I believe that the question of *who owns the internet* cannot be answered without understanding *where and how the internet lives* --- both as a body of infrastructure built with particular contexts and as a body of interfaces built in particular contexts. 

**Surveillance architectures**

Surveillance is a means of establishing asymmetrical power relations --- you know (or can conjecture given data) my next move, I don't know yours. Or, you will see my movements, and the consequences will be dire, so I will not make them. Certain architectures serve surveillance better than others. 

To some extent, whoever controls infrastructure controls surveillance. And those who get to control the infrastructure ultimately tend to be whoever has access to the most weapons --- in this case mainly weapons like the law, money, and math. 

**My IRL is not your IRL**

All this is to say that on an interface level *there are many internets* --- for me, I access the internet primarily one mobile device and a laptop. These both have particular operating systems, and they've been a presence in my life for x number of years. There are lots of people whose internet lives take place in different architectures --- say, only on mobile devices, only on library computers between specific hours during the week, only at school. I speak from a highly privileged internet, and I need to be up front about that.
